## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor 

### What I learned

In this project I used Vue, explored new structures and new ways of styling. Navbar mobile version was particularly challenging, but I got a better understanding of how CSS transitions works and I hope to have less problems next time.

I used BEM and SASS, I'm not sure if it was the best way, but it certainly flowed better in this project than the previous one, I'm starting to understand how to use and apply them better.

That's it, keep learning!
